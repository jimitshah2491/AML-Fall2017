# Porto Seguroâ€™s Safe Driver Prediction

The pupose of this project is to find out the probability with which a driver will claim insurance in the next
year. This information is used to decide how much the driver will need to pay for insurance. Therefore, safe
drivers would pay lesser for insurance relatively than other drivers. This project was a part of a Kaggle competition.
